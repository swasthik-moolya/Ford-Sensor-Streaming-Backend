<h3>KEY FEATURES:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Robust Flask Server: Efficiently handles data ingestion and retrieval.</li>
  <li>High-Performance Redis Database: Ensures lightning-fast data storage and access.</li>
  <li>Intuitive Endpoints: Streamlined /record and /collect APIs for seamless integration.</li>
  <li>Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle increasing data volumes and user loads.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How it works:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Sensor Data Ingestion: Embedded vehicle sensors periodically transmit data to the /record endpoint.</li>
  <li>Data Storage: Incoming data is meticulously stored in the Redis database for rapid access.</li>
  <li>Data Retrieval: The /collect endpoint provides a gateway for the mobile application to fetch the latest data.</li>
</ol>
  <h3>Technologies used:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Python: For server-side logic and API development.</li>
  <li>Flask: As the web framework for building the RESTful API.</li>
  <li>Redis: As the in-memory data structure store for high-performance data storage.</li>
</ol>
